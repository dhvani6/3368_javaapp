= CIS 3368 Final Exam

== Part 1 (Coding)

1) Run the tests in the file `FinalExamApplicationTests`. Write code (or correct errors) to make
the tests pass.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do NOT modify the test code in any way! Do not proceed to Problem 2 until all tests pass.
--

2) Run the application by running `FinalExamApplication`. Write the code required so that when
a user clicks the `Add Mouse` button, a new mouse is created and added to the list of mice.
The new mouse should have its name taken from whatever text is in the adjacent text box.
The new mouse should _not_ be added to the cat.

2) When a mouse is added to the cat, it should be removed from the mice list. Fix the code so that
the mouse is removed when dragged to the cat.

3) The `Barf!` button currently does nothing. Add code to the application so that the button
calls the `dropMice` method in the `Cat` class, and then clears the list of mice for the cat (NOT the left
hand list of unassigned mice).
